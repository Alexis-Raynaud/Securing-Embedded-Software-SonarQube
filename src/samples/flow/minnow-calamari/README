The options will be read from sol-flow.conf. For sample
calamari-buttons-rgb-led.fbp, you'll be able to set
GPIO pins according to the version of your kernel (<= 3.17,
or 3.19). Consult the calarmari-3.17.conf or
calamari-3.19.conf and change GPIO pins for nodes LedRed,
LedGreen, LedBlue, Button1, Button2 and Button3 in
sol-flow.conf accordingly.

For the remaining samples, due to a different implementation,
the GPIO pins are hardcoded for kernel <= 3.17 and cannot be
changed through conffile. Be sure you run those samples
on appropriate kernel version.
