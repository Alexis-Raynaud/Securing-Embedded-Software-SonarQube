When running 'make check-fbp' or 'make check-fbp-valgrind' most files
*.fbp in this directory and subdirectories will be called using
runner, and the error code or output will be checked. These targets
support the parameter V=1 to be more verbose.

If there's only the FBP file, the exit code will be checked to decide
on failure.

Optionally there can be either a '-expected.txt' or
'-expected-fail.txt', which will also check whether the output is
exactly the same. The "fail" variant will expect the runner to fail,
this is useful for testing runner errors.

For example

    my-test.fbp
    my-test-expected.txt OR my-test-expected-fail.txt

Don't depend on output messages from SOL_WRN and friends on the
expected files since they contain implementation information (line,
column, file name in the source) that might change as the code
evolves.

In all cases it's important that your flow ends at some point, look at
the 'test' or 'app' modules to ways to do it. Usually TEST_RESULT is
good enough.

Skipped files:

* Files that end with '_disabled.fbp'.
